# OVERVIEW

* This program demonstrates how an ESP32 can interface a SLAMTEC RPLIDAR C1 
* The source code (rpLidar.cpp) is mostly derived from https://github.com/KKest/ESP-rplidarS2

# NOTES

* I tested it only with the RPLIDAR C1 model (it's the only lidar I have :smiley: ) and I suppose it won't work with other models without some modifications. 
* I used an ESP32 D1 Mini but I'm pretty sure any ESP32 will suffice.
